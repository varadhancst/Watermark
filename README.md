# Watermark
you can add the watermark on images

I developed a program to add a watermark to an image using Python and Tkinter. The program allows users to select an image file and a watermark text, and then adjust the transparency and position of the watermark on the original image. The program also includes a preview feature to display the resulting image before saving it to a file. This project demonstrates my ability to use Tkinter to create a graphical user interface and to manipulate image files using the Python Image library.
